# Billomat-Problems

Finding some problems with Billomats API:

Problem 1 & 2 are demonstrated in billomat.py

## 1. Creating an invoice from an offer - the items, text a.e. from the offer aren't copied to the new invoice
-> doc: https://www.billomat.com/api/rechnungen/

## 2. Getting the offer - items from the offer doesn't work as it should in the documentation: 
-> https://www.billomat.com/api/angebote/positionen/ 

## 3. the english documentation has a major error: 
-> if you click on items (under invoice, recurrings or estimates) you're always ending up on the recurrings -items site.
